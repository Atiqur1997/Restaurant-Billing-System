During the winter break I joined a winter training program on phython at Gauhati University . In this i made a digital billing system for restaurants . In this as a person enters the restaurant he is shown the menu card and asked what he wants to order along with the quantity . Then, the bill is made and shown to him. He is asked if he wants to give the order or not. He can order the food if he wants to do so.
